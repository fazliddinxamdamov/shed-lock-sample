Scheduling jobs is one of the core requirements nowadays when we develop an application on a large scale. Since we are using the spring boot application as our reference, we know that the schedular works well with a single instance. As soon as we scale up our application to multiple nodes, we need to ensure that our application is ready for this architecture. The scheduled part of the application requires changes before they fit into such an architecture. SpringBoot cannot handle scheduler synchronisation itself over multiple nodes as it executes the jobs simultaneously on each node. Hence, Shedlock is the ideal candidate for this scenario. In this article, weâ€™ll look, how we can use Shedlock to execute a scheduled task using the Spring Boot application.
